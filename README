numbers.vim
===========
Github: https://github.com/b3niup/numbers.vim


numbers.vim is a plugin for intelligently toggling line numbers.  
It is a fork of @myusuf3 plugin.

This plugin alternates between relative (`relativenumber`), absolute (`number`)  
and hidden line numbering for active window depending on the mode you are in.

In `hidden` mode all event-based mode changes are turned off to keep numbers  
hidden untill next `NumbersToggle` or `NumbersEnable` call.

Commands are included for toggling the line numbering method and for enabling and disabling the plugin.


Hiding numbers in plugins and files
-----------------------------------

If you would like to hide numbers in vim plugins or in files with specified filetype you can set custom g:numbers_exclude list in your .vimrc:

    let g:numbers_exclude = ['nerdtree', 'html']

This example will hide numbers in NERD Tree and all html files.

By default plugin excludes following filetypes:

    let g:numbers_exclude = ['minibufexpl', 'nerdtree', 'unite', 'tagbar', 'startify', 'gundo', 'vimshell', 'w3m']

Be sure to include this superset in your .vimrc if you only would like to extend it.


Usage
-----

Once installed, no action is *required* on your part.  
But for convenience, you may want to add mappings in your `.vimrc` for some of the commands, e.g.,

    nnoremap <silent> <F2> :NumbersToggle<CR>


It is though *strongly recommended* to use following mapping:

    inoremap <C-c> <Esc><Esc>

It is a workaround for issue where `InsertLeave` event is not working with Ctrl+c.  
Another way to fix this is add `autocmd CursorMoved * :call NumbersReset()` in `NumbersEnable()` function   
around line 104 in `plugin/numbers.vim`, but personally I do not like idea of calling even such light function with every cursor move.
